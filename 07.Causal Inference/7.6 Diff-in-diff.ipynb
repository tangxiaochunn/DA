    "## Three Billboards in the South of Brazil\n",
    "\n",
    "I remember when I worked with marketing and a great way to do it was with internet advertisement. Not because it is very efficient (although it is), but because it is very easy to know if it's effective or not. With online marketing, you have a way of knowing which customers saw the ad and you can track them with cookies to see if they ended up on your landing page or clicked some download button. You can also use machine learning to find prospects that are very similar to your customers and present the ad only to them. In this sense, online marketing is very precise: you target only those you want to and you can see if they respond as you would like them to. \n",
    "\n",
    "But not everyone is susceptible to online marketing. Sometimes you have to resort to less precise techniques, like a TV campaign or placing a billboard down the street. Usually, diversity of marketing channels is something marketing departments look for. But if online marketing is a professional fishing rod to catch that specific type of tuna, billboard and TV are giant nets you throw at a fish shoal and hope to catch at least some big ones. Another problem with billboard and TV ads is that it is much harder to know how effective they are. Sure, you could measure the purchase volume, or whatever you want to drive, before and after placing a billboard somewhere. If there is an increase, there is some evidence that the marketing is effective. But how would you know if this increase is not just some natural trend in the awareness of your product? In other words, how would you know the counterfactual $Y_0$ of what would have happened if you didn't set up the billboards in the first place? \n",
    "\n",
    "One technique to answer these types of questions is Difference-in-Difference, or diff-in-diff for close friends. Diff-in-diff is commonly used to assess the effect of macro interventions, like the effect of immigration on unemployment, the effect of gun law changes in crime rates or simply the difference in user engagement due to a marketing campaign. In all these cases, you have a period before and after the intervention and you wish to untangle the impact of the intervention from a general trend. As a motivating example, let's look at a question similar to the one I had to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to figure out how good billboards were as a marketing channel, we placed 3 billboards in the city of Porto Alegre, the capital of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. We wanted to see if that boosted deposits into our savings account. As a note for those not very familiar with Brazilian geography, Rio Grande do Sul is part of the south of the country, one of the most developed regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having this in mind, we decided to also look at data from another capital from the south, Florianopolis, the capital city of the state of Santa Catarina. The idea is that we could use Florianopolis as a control sample to estimate the counterfactual $Y_0$ when compared to Porto Alegre (by the way, this was not the true experiment, which is confidential, but the idea is very similar). We placed the billboard in Porto Alegre for the entire month of June. The data we have looks like this:"

If we turn the POA dummy off and turn the July dummy on, we get $\\beta_0 + \\beta_2$, which is the level of Florianópolis in July, after the intervention period. $\\beta_2$ is then the trend of the control, since we add it on top of the baseline to get the level of the control at the period post intervention. As a recap, $\\beta_1$ is the increment we get by going from the control to the treated, $\\beta_2$ is the increment we get by going from the period before to the period after the intervention. Finally, if we turn both dummies on, we get $\\beta_3$. $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3$ is the level in Porto Alegre after the intervention.

    "\n",
    "One obvious problem with Diff-in-Diff is failure to satisfy the parallel trend assumption. If the growth trend from the treated is different from the trend of the control, diff-in-diff will be biased. This is a common problem with non-random data, where the decision to treat a region is based on its potential to respond well to the treatment, or when the treatment is targeted at regions that are not performing very well. Take our marketing example. We decided to test billboards in Porto Alegre not in order to check the effect of billboards in general. The reason is simply because sales perform poorly there. Perhaps online marketing is not working there. In this case, it could be that the growth we would see in Porto Alegre without a billboard would be lower than the growth we observe in other cities. This would cause us to underestimate the effect of the billboard there.\n",

Say for instance you don't have data on what each of our customers from Florianópolis or Porto Alegre did. Instead, you only have the average deposits before and after the intervention for both cities.
